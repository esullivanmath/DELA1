\chapter{Infinite Series}
To wrap up this course we discuss an incredibly useful tool in mathematics: the infinite
series.  It may come as a surprise, but it is entire possible to add infinitely many
things together and get a finite sum.  For a deep exploration of this idea we return to
the Active Calculus Textbook.
